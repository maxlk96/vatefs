## Code Style Guidelines

### JavaScript/Vue

- Use ES6+ features
- Use `const` and `let`, avoid `var`
- Use arrow functions for callbacks
- Use template literals for string interpolation
- Follow Vue 3 Composition API patterns
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### Vue Components

- Use PascalCase for component names
- Use kebab-case in templates
- Keep components focused and single-purpose
- Use props for parent-child communication
- Use emits for child-parent communication

### Naming Conventions

- **Components**: PascalCase (e.g., `FlightStrip.vue`)
- **Files**: kebab-case (e.g., `socket-service.js`)
- **Variables/Functions**: camelCase (e.g., `createStrip`)
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `MAX_STRIPS`)
